disturbing the visitor experience and operations at Cumberland Island National Seashore and destroying public and private property .\n","The Camden (Georgia) County Board of Commissioners sees the spaceport as an economic boon , one that could both attract commercial space flight companies and tourists interested in craning their necks as a launch arcs through the sky .\n","Unlike other communities along Georgia's 100-mile-long coast that have developed thriving tourist communities on their barrier islands , Camden County can't fully leverage its barrier island economically because it's home to the national seashore and off-limits to tourism infrastructure .\n","With the Federal Aviation Administration poised to release a final environmental impact statement on the proposed launch facility by mid-December , with a go-no go decision from the agency expected in January , interested parties ranging from the National Park Service and environmental advocacy groups to private landowners on Little Cumberland Island are worried that the agency won't sufficiently answer questions that they raised a year ago when the draft EIS was made available for public review .\n","It's a scenario that paints a picture of as many as a dozen commercial launches a year that would arc across the northern end of Cumberland Island National Seashore , where the seashore's official wilderness area spans more than 9,800 acres , with another 10,000-acre tract of potential wilderness .\n","While NASA long has handled space launches for the United States , recent years have seen the rise of private rocket companies that see a profit to be made in taking on at least some of NASA's workload , and commercial spaceports have surfaced to support those companies .\n","We have nothing against rocket ships unless they’re being launched over one of the largest maritime wildernesses on the East Coast , said Emily Jones , who works in National Parks Conservation Association’s Southeast office .\n","Spaceport Camden is committed to learning from NASA’s best practices for nighttime lighting and is already working with environmental groups and federal and state agencies to ensure our lighting plan will meet or exceed the practices implemented at KSC , the site added .\n","Kevin Lang , an Athens , Georgia , attorney working with a group opposed to the spaceport , pointed out during a phone call that the national seashore is visited by 60,000 people a year , and that there are privately owned inholdings within the seashore's boundaries .\n","One of our biggest concerns is the fact that a lot of rocket failures do occur early , in the first stage of launch , and a rocket failure over the Cumberland Island National Seashore would likely result in a rocket that is almost fully loaded at that point with fuel , he said , envisioning the possible scenarios that could result from such a failure .\n","Analysis of a proposed spaceport in Camden County shows the project has potential to create new jobs , increase tourism , boost the local economy and position the region to take advantage of a growing commercial space industry .\n","McKay said the university study looked at the impacts of both construction of a spaceport and operations once launches are conducted at the site .\n","What makes Camden County such an attractive site when other commercial spaceports have struggled is the central location near other facilities including sites in Virginia , Florida , Mississippi and Alabama .\n","Bob Scaringe , a consultant with AVG Communications , said the commercial space industry continues to grow because private launch sites can launch rockets on a schedule favorable to their needs instead of the federal government’s at Kennedy Space Center .\n","Governor Casey each presented benefits Spaceport Camden will offer the State of Georgia and commercial space operators .\n","The Spaceport Camden project utilizes Georgia’s high-technology industry and cutting-edge research capabilities , bringing significant economic opportunities to coastal Georgia as the space industry continues its growth , Governor Deal stated in his letter .\n","Governor Casey Cagle echoed Governor Deals sentiments , noting Camden is the ideal region for space vehicle manufacturing due to its location … and also offers a lunch range that is virtually unrestricted for the launch of spacecrafts to a wide range of orbits Cagle , who is running to be Georgia Governor , further noted the regional benefits Spaceport Camden offers neighboring states stating this Spaceport not only opens up the door for economic growth in our state , but puts the Southeast on the cutting edge of scientific development .\n","Spaceport Camden , coupled with NASA’s presence in Alabama and Florida along with Georgia’s expertise in aerospace engineering and manufacturing has the potential to put coastal Georgia at the epicenter of a new space corridor in the Southeast .\n","Other candidates for Georgia Governor , such as Secretary of State Brian Kemp and former Minority Leader Stacey Abrams , have also given support for Spaceport Camden .\n","Today , the Camden County Board of Commissioners formally submitted its application for a Launch Site Operator License LSOL to the Federal Aviation Administration’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation .\n","Commission Vice Chairman Gary Blount added , This launch site operator license application has been a strategic priority of the Board of County Commissioners for several years and we are proud to report to the citizens of Camden County that it has been submitted .\n","Camden will retain that title again , said Spaceport Camden project leader and County Administrator Steve Howard .\n","Spaceport Camden is a visionary project that will bring high-paying aerospace jobs to Southeast Georgia while supporting a new wave of STEM education and career opportunities to the region .\n","Former Speaker of the House and member of the National Space Council Users Advisory Group , Newt Gingrich , joined Camden officials in celebrating the successful application submission and noted the importance of the project for US competitiveness in commercial space exploration .\n","Spaceport Camden is an ideal location for the safe launch of the small satellites and rockets that are rapidly becoming the most important segment of this new market .\n","The Spaceport , local colleges and the nearby opportunities for the development , manufacture and test of satellites , ground hardware and rockets are valuable assets for the economic growth of Coastal Georgia and the space launch industry .\n","In June , both US Senators and the entire House Delegation from Georgia sent letters to the FAA supporting the Spaceport Camden draft environmental impact statement .\n","After a two-year open comment process , a potential commercial space site on Georgia’s coast is moving forward with bipartisan political and business leadership support .\n","Should the site be approved , the project could almost immediately begin bringing some of the soon-to-be trillion-dollar commercial space market to the state .\n","But Camden County administrator and project lead Steve Howard says that’s a waste .\n","Additional support notes were submitted by former Speaker of the House and National Space Council Advisory Group member Newt Gingrich ; the private Commercial Spaceflight Federation ; the Coastal Regional Commission of Georgia ; and Vector Space Systems , a commercial space startup that launched a small , low-altitude test rocket from Camden last summer .\n","Now , Camden County will submit an official launch site operator license application , after which the FAA has six months to issue a final decision on a launch site operator’s license .\n","Howard says the FAA will examine all facets of the project — economic impact , environmental factors and more — to determine whether the site will be approved .\n","The support from elected officials , commercial space companies , and space policy advocates all reaches the same conclusion : The United States needs more launch capacity and Spaceport Camden is best suited to meet this demand .\n","Should Spaceport Camden become a reality , Howard says they have already had multiple commercial space companies reach out expressing interest in using the site .\n","This launch represents both the first customer-funded launch operation for the new space commercial launch industry , as well as the first launch out of the historic Spaceport Camden in Georgia , which was originally used by NASA in the 1960’s for ground-based static fire testing of large solid rocket motors , according to a statement provided by Vector .\n","Our historic launch today is a testament to the hard work of the Vector team , as well as support from NASA and Spaceport Camden .\n","A primary objective of the launch was to demonstrate and evaluate a next-generation engine injector developed through collaborative research with the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center , company officials said .\n","Georgia looks forward to working with commercial space companies , like Vector , as we begin the next chapter of space exploration and innovation , he said .\n","An ongoing environmental assessment conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration due to be completed later this year will likely determine if rockets are ever regularly launched into orbit from the site .\n","Detractors say the county has already spent millions of dollars on a project that will never be approved because most of the launch trajectories are over Cumberland Island National Seashore .\n","Built through partnerships with private companies , the area could become the first exclusively commercial spaceport on the East Coast ; the others in Florida and Virginia are operated by or associated with federal agencies .\n","Spaceport Camden is strategically located on the coast , which would allow rockets to launch east over mostly open ocean , posing little risk to populated areas on land .\n","So far , many commercial space companies have shown interest in the place , according to county officials .\n","Camden County , which the spaceport is named after , is currently working to get the site licensed for launches by the Federal Aviation Administration .\n","I think we have the opportunity to build the first exclusive non-federal range on the East Coast , Steve Howardm , the Camden County administrator and head of the Spaceport Camden initiative , tells The Verge .\n","Then , a little less than five years ago , a space company reached out to the state of Georgia , looking for a new location to launch its rockets .\n","That initial meeting prompted Camden County officials to meet with other private spaceflight companies to gauge interest in a Georgia spaceport where the booster plant once lived .\n","For a while , the Spaceport Camden initiative was just a promising idea , but now the state of Georgia has shown it’s serious about the project .\n","In August , a spaceflight startup named Vector launched one of its test rockets from the site — though the vehicle didn’t reach orbit .\n","Currently , 10 sites throughout the US hold FAA licenses to operate as commercial spaceports .\n","A report done by space consulting firm Astralytical found that Spaceport Camden could be a great home for businesses that not only launch from the site , but also design their vehicles there
