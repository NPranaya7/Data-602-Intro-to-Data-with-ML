        "text1=\"\"\"The Federal Aviation Administration is set to require a new environmental review for a scaled-down proposal to launch rockets off coastal Georgia, creating a new hurdle for Camden County’s eight-year quest to create a Spaceport. The federal agency announced Tuesday it will require Camden County to prepare another draft of an Environmental Impact Statement for its proposed spaceport, a controversial project local officials say will bring tourism and other economic benefits to the region. Environmental groups and other critics have railed against the potential safety hazards posed by the project. The revised environmental study requirement comes after the county downsized the rockets it plans to launch in its new license application in December to about the size of a mini-fridge. The project’s scope shrank after the FAA raised concerns about how the county could safeguard people who live near the proposed launch site. The U.S. Navy, which operates Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay about 10 miles away near the Florida border, also expressed national security concerns. Environmental groups, including the National Parks Conservation Association, One Hundred Miles and the Southern Environmental Law Center asked the FAA for another ecological review on the revised project. The groups are worried rocket launches could damage nearby Cumberland Island National Seashore. “Small rockets fail at a much higher rate than medium to large rockets, so the FAA must now consider the environmental impacts of these risky, unproven vehicles,” said Brian Gist, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Given the enormous risks Spaceport Camden poses to public health, private property and Cumberland Island, this is not the time for shortcuts and half-measures.” Camden’s revised plans call for smaller rockets as county officials aim to take part in the private space industry that includes satellites and potentially space tourism, suborbital travel and mining asteroids. The county first asked federal regulators to allow rockets as big as 230-foot tall SpaceX Falcon 9. Camden officials continued to express confidence in getting the project off the ground and said this week they’ve gained momentum now that the FAA is only asking the county for environmental and policy information. Camden taxpayers are on the hook for about $8 million so far, betting the Spaceport will one day generate a return on investment. “Today’s FAA release puts us one step closer to retaining the title of the Gateway to Space and bringing high tech opportunities to rural Georgia,” said Steve Howard, Camden’s administrator. “We will be continuing to work in parallel with the FAA, and we are looking forward to the next steps that have been outlined in the release. We hope for the project to move swiftly and smoothly in the upcoming months.” If approved, the spaceport would be one of 12 sites licensed in the U.S. to launch privately owned rockets. Located on a roughly 12,000-acre industrial property south of Brunswick, the county planned for the spaceport to attract tourists to watch rockets like the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch until it abruptly changed course late last year. Nearly eight years into its quest to build a spaceport in coastal Georgia, Camden County is proposing the use of drones and aerial surveillance on launch days, as part of a plan to monitor the number of people on private property and in a national park, which lie beneath its proposed rocket trajectories. NPR Atlanta affiliate WABE reports landowners say they were not consulted about the plans. It exacerbates an already-fraught relationship between the county and, in particular, some private landowners on Little Cumberland over the project. In its revised launch site operator license application, obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the county also says the new, smaller rockets it plans to launch could fail at least three times more often than its original plan. The issue of ensuring the safety of visitors and homeowners on Cumberland Island and Little Cumberland Island has dogged Camden’s proposal for years. No vertical-launch spaceports in the country launch over private homes, and the FAA has asked the county repeatedly how it would work. Camden submitted an updated application to operate a spaceport for smaller rockets in January after originally proposing to launch medium-to-large rockets. County leaders cited a more favorable market for small launch vehicles as the reason for the last-minute switch. The county declined a request for an interview about the revised application after being provided a copy of the document WABE is releasing. In a statement, the Board of Commissioners said the county “is not in a position to determine the authenticity of the document” and pointed to the “applicability of a variety of laws explicitly protecting the information contained in the Application from public disclosure.” “There’s no guarantee in anything. There’s risk in doing something and risk in doing nothing,” said Camden County Administrator Steve Howard about the project in a January interview. “And that’s why the board is looking at this as a potential opportunity.” “It’s important to me, it’s important to us as well to build for the future to make sure our citizens have opportunities,” he said. The county has invested more than $8 million on the proposal in an effort to create a new industry and jobs in Camden County by way of a commercial vertical-launch spaceport. A spaceport site operator license does not allow rockets to launch; proposed launches by rocket companies would each need to be subsequently licensed by the FAA. In the population monitoring and management plan in the revised application, the county proposes to track visitors to Cumberland Island National Seashore on launch days through the National Park Service’s existing public ferry and camping reservation system. But there are also private homes with residents and visitors on Cumberland, as well as private boaters who land on the beaches, who are not tracked by the park service. The county proposes to monitor private arrivals to Cumberland through Camden County first responders, National Park Service rangers, and “if necessary, fixed wing and drone aircraft operating under FAA regulations.” Unmanned aircraft are generally prohibited in the National Park System, except when “approved in writing” by the agency. Carol Ruckdeschel lives on Cumberland Island. She said she was not consulted about the plans and isn’t aware of any other residents being consulted. “It seems like it’s an incredible burden on the park service but also an incredible imposition on the wilderness area. People don’t come here expecting to be spied on with drones, airplanes, personnel, checkpoints and things like that.” “As a Camden County taxpayer, I’m not happy about it,” she said. “We’re all footing the bill for this folly.” Jill Hamilton-Anderson, spokeswoman for the Cumberland Island National Seashore, declined to comment on the plans because the agency had not yet received a copy of the revised application at this stage in the process. In previous comments to the FAA, the agency has been critical of the project’s original proposal. On Little Cumberland Island, which is privately owned, the county proposes to count the number of owners and visitors present on a launch day through the island homeowners association’s on-site caretaker. Additionally, the county proposes to monitor Little Cumberland visitation through “shore-based video surveillance (and if employed, drone and/or fixed wing aircraft).” Kevin Lang, vice president of the Little Cumberland Homes Association, confirmed landowners were not consulted about the details in advance of the application. He said the plan is “a little invasive and it’s pretty surreal to read in the application that that’s how they intend to treat our community.” “I’m not aware of any local government anywhere in our country that deploys these type of methods to try to verify the population of a particular area or where people are,” Lang said. “I believe it’s unprecedented. Of course, it’s also unprecedented to launch rockets over a residential community as well, so this project has a lot of unprecedented elements to it.” “I think the question would be, why won’t folks work with us to help us?” said Howard, Camden’s administrator, in January about the protests of some Little Cumberland Island homeowners. “And that’s kind of what I think the question should be. Why wouldn’t you help prosperity for a community? Why wouldn’t you be able to do this 12 times a year? Why couldn’t you do it? And I think those are things you’d have to look at. And nobody’s taking anybody’s property.” Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst who helped found and develop what is now Space Florida at Cape Canaveral, said there’s no precedent that he’s aware of in the United States for surveillance of private property during launches, nor any American precedent for homes beneath rocket trajectories. “Maybe the best corollary would be what China’s doing,” he said. “At their Xichang spaceport, entire villages are located downrange. Their spent rocket stages routinely fall near populated areas, sometimes destroying homes and private property.” Ellegood said Camden’s proposal would create a difficult situation for both residents and launch operators. And launching rockets is not easy to begin with. He pointed to Astra, a California startup that’s struggled recently to hold its first successful launch at Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska. “They’ve had problem after problem trying to overcome technical issues, weather issues, issues with the range and issues with the spaceport infrastructure itself,” he said. “Imagine if there were homes downrange and the repeated restrictions that would be put on those homes, and then imagine how people not obeying those restrictions might impact the launch operation,” he said. Camden County’s plans also include closure of waters near the site. Boats would need “pre-authorization as a property owner or registered guests of an owner” in order to pass through the “Safety Zone” maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard on a launch day. Closing public waterways is common for coastal spaceports around the country, and several launches have been scrubbed because of wayward boats in closed downrange waters, including one of Astra’s in Alaska earlier this month. In 2018, several local fishermen testified in Camden about the negative effect closing those waters for commercial space activity would have on their businesses. When conducting a safety analysis of Camden’s proposed trajectories in 2018, an FAA engineer pointed out that a smaller vehicle would reduce a casualty area, but that those smaller rockets could be less reliable and have a higher probability of failure. In its revised application addressing safety, the county tripled the probability of rocket failure to 20% for smaller rockets, from the original range of 2.5% to 6% for medium-to-large launch vehicles. When asked about this increased failure rate for smaller rockets in January, as compared to the county’s original proposal, Howard with Camden County suggested to WABE the FAA emails were outdated. “We want a mature rocket launching from Spaceport Camden. But let’s not forget the whole reason behind this project,” he continued. “It’s really not about launching. That’s the catalyst, but you want everything else around it: STEM programs, educational programs, manufacturing, all those kinds of things.” The county proposes up to 12 launches per year, with up to an additional 42 wet dress and static fire engine tests. A 20% failure rate would equate to at least two of those launches per year. In its calculation of risk for the uninvolved public beneath the proposed rocket paths, which is required by the FAA’s licensing process, the county outlined a “conservative” estimate of population present on the islands. Per Camden’s calculations, their proposed launches would pass the FAA’s safety regulations. Launches, by Camden’s calculations, would only exceed the level of risk to the general public prohibited by the federal government in the uninhabited marsh nearest to the proposed spaceport site. But the plan is still problematic, argued Brian Gist, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has advocated against the proposal on environmental and good governance grounds. “What they’re trying to do is make the numbers work while trying to launch rockets over a downrange community,” he said. “The formula is intended to calculate a certain degree of risk. But whether it’s one person in a house or 40 people in a house, if that house is hit by debris from a rocket, that’s still going to be a terrible outcome for that person or those people.” “How do you determine a risk factor?” asked Ruckdeschel. “Seems like one person would be too many. There’s a lot I don’t understand about [the proposal] at all.” Another section of Camden County’s revised application, which was expressly requested by the FAA, is its plan to fight potential fires caused by rocket debris on Little Cumberland Island. The county proposes using specially equipped ATVs, which would land on Little Cumberland beaches in the event of a fire, and explained it is also repairing a water buffalo for the island to contribute to the mitigation efforts. The county predicts that with these ATVs pre-staged in the water they would be able to reach any area of the island within 15 to 30 minutes. Lang of the island’s homeowners association calls the plan “completely inadequate.” “You’re not going to be able to get there quickly enough,” he said. “And when you’re there, there are parts of the island that are only accessible by foot. You can’t get machinery of any significant size in to fight the fire. You’re not going to be able to mobilize enough via the air to get enough water on a multi-point fire.” He pointed out that vehicles are only able to access the island from the beaches in a few places because of a bluff around its exterior, and, while it has a trail system, most of the island remains inaccessible. Lang said there’s been “absolutely no communication” between the county and Little Cumberland about the plans in the application that involve the island. “We know our island better than they know our island. And for them not to engage with us at all and to develop this mitigation plan is pretty amazing.” “The lack of transparency has allowed this project to exist for five years,” Lang argued. “If Camden County had actually revealed to the public what’s going on with this project and been evenhanded that launching rockets is very unlikely, then the support for this project would melt away.” Gist, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, also decried the lack of transparency about the project throughout the process. His organization has settled a lawsuit with the FAA about unfilled Freedom of Information Act requests related to the spaceport, and sued the county on behalf of One Hundred Miles environmental group over alleged Georgia Open Records Act violations. “This project is an example of why open records laws exist,” he said. “The public shouldn’t have to jump through a bunch of hoops to figure out basic information about a project when that information deals with things like risk of bodily harm, risk to their property, government management of private property. Those are things that the public should have access to and has a right to know.” On behalf of One Hundred Miles, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has amended its ongoing lawsuit in Camden County Superior Court against Camden County and Spaceport Camden consultant Andrew Nelson for failing to meet requirements under the Georgia Open Records Act. Over the past several years, One Hundred Miles and SELC have sent a series of public records requests to the County about what would happen in the event of a rocket explosion from the proposed spaceport or in the air over nearby communities and sensitive coastal areas, including Little Cumberland Island and the Cumberland Island National Seashore. The groups have repeatedly asked for critical information concerning evacuation zones, hazard areas, and safety zones, as well as the County’s formal license application to operate a commercial spaceport submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Camden County has refused to provide one single page of public records in response to these requests. “After more than seven years, the County continues to keep even the most basic details about this project from the public by violating the law,” said Megan Desrosiers, Executive Director of One Hundred Miles. “How can Camden communities feel assured that millions of their tax payer dollars are being spent wisely when they are denied any semblance of transparency?” Documents obtained through SELC’s now-settled federal challenge against the FAA contain the same information that Camden County continues to withhold, and in some cases are the exact documents in full. Other documents released by the FAA demonstrate that the County routinely and illegally marks public records as exempt from disclosure, despite having no confidential information. One such document is the County’s revised license application following its last-minute decision in December 2019 to change the project from launching medium-to-large sized rockets to launching only small launch vehicles, which fail at a significantly higher rate. “Camden County has gone to great lengths to hide the serious risks this project poses to public safety, personal property, and coastal way of life,” said April Lipscomb, Senior Attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “It’s time for the County to stop this pattern of hiding information.” The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Commercial Space Transportation is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze the environmental impacts of a proposed commercial space launch site (known as Spaceport Camden) in Camden County, Georgia. The Camden County, Georgia Board of Commissioners (the County) proposes to develop a launch site for the integration, test, and launch of vertical launch vehicles. Under the Proposed Action analyzed in the EIS, the County would construct and operate Spaceport Camden, a commercial space launch site consisting of a vertical launch site, a landing zone, a control center complex, and another facility that would include provisions for visitors and viewing launches. The County plans to offer the site for up to 12 vertical launches per year. The County will be required to obtain a Launch Site Operator License from the FAA for the operation of the proposed Spaceport Camden. The FAA is the lead Federal agency for preparing the EIS for analyzing the environmental impacts of the proposal. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Park Service (NPS) are cooperating agencies. The EIS will evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposal, including construction of launch site infrastructure, launch operations, offsite communication, control, and launch facilities, and provisions for visitors and viewing launches. The EIS will evaluate the Proposed Action along with the No Action Alternative, and other reasonable alternatives that may be identified during the scoping process. The applicant will work together with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to obtain a Section 404 permit, as necessary, before constructing the proposed site. Revised analyses have confirmed that all potential environmental impacts of the small-lift launch vehicles are subsumed within the potential impacts of the medium-large lift class vehicle disclosed to the public in the Draft EIS, issued in March 2018. Moreover, the FAA will perform additional NEPA analyses for applications from future launch vehicle operators seeking to operate from Spaceport Camden. This additional analysis would address the potential impacts of the launch of their specific vehicle. The FAA also believes that expediting the environmental review process for Spaceport Camden furthers the interests of Executive Order 13927, Accelerating the Nation’s Economic Recovery from the COVID-19 Emergency by Expediting Infrastructure Investments and Other Activities. The FAA has therefore revised its approach and will issue a Final EIS without an additional public comment period. The Final EIS will address updates to the Proposed Action since the release of the 2018 Draft EIS and will consider the updates across all appropriate resource areas. The Final EIS will incorporate responses to all comments received on the 2018 Draft EIS. The FAA is actively developing the Final EIS which is expected to be released in March 2021. The Final EIS addresses Camden’s proposed launch site operations. Camden County and the Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER) at Georgia Southern University has released a new study on the economic impact of space tourism on coastal Georgia. The report estimates that a single launch could attract approximately 4,000-5,000 visitors to the area. CBAER estimates that 38 to 45 jobs connected to tourism and hospitality would be supported long-term by the project as well. While there would be some additional new jobs as a result, the primary impact on employment would likely be adding more hours to existing employees, shifting employees from part-time to full-time work, or increasing their income due to increased customer traffic and visitor counts. “Building Spaceport Camden could bolster additional spending in the area’s hospitality industry throughout Camden County and the southeast Georgia region,” said Benjamin McKay, Assistant Director for the Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER). “The potential per-launch benefit to total employee compensation (Labor Income) could reach $1.1 million, with sizeable increases in the total goods and services used in the region (Gross Regional Product) and total business sales (Output).” CBAER estimates that from Spaceport Camden could increase the gross regional product of southeast Georgia by as much as $1.8 million and increase total business sales by as much as $3.6 million per launch. “Having overseen the Eastern Range for the United States Air Force and been involved with commercial space for the past decade, I can attest to the growing launch demand in the commercial space sector,” said Major General Robert S. Dickman, former USAF commander of the 45th Space Wing, former Director of the Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral, and current Camden County resident. “Spaceport Camden is an ideal location for the safe launch of the small satellites and rockets that are rapidly becoming the most important segment of this new market.” Georgia Southern University previously estimated that Spaceport Camden would generate more than $22 million in annual economic activity in addition to the more than $9 million in economic activity that will be generated from construction in the first 15 months of operations. However, this previous study did not research the impact of Spaceport Camden on tourism and hospitality. “Small-lift launch vehicle launches mean big business for our hotels and restaurants,” said Camden County Administrator and Spaceport Camden project lead, Steve Howard. “Many hospitality businesses have been suffering as a result of COVID-19. This report shows that a launch from Spaceport Camden can revitalize Camden’s tourism industry and ignite our recovery.” Spaceport Camden is a speculative attempt to bolster one rural county’s economy, but it jeopardizes its most valuable natural resource — one that belongs to every one of us: a federally-protected Wilderness Area and Cumberland Island National Seashore. Small rocket launches can send flaming debris and toxic material from the sky, destroying the habitats of threatened and endangered species, and can ignite Cumberland Island’s centuries-old maritime forest. Our coast is of value and significance to every Georgian. To minimize the implications of a project like this on both the state and national levels is a severe oversight by Governor Kemp. Most importantly – allowing an unnecessary, for-profit spaceport to launch over this Wilderness Area sets a dangerous precedent for ALL Wilderness Areas in the United States. The FAA will issue its final decision for the Spaceport Camden launch site in March 2021, without opportunity for further public comment. If this project moves forward, we are allowing wilderness to be superseded by the interests of private stakeholders at any time. Our officials must understand that a Spaceport should never be authorized to fly over protected Wilderness. Currently Spaceport Camden remains under environmental review and permitting by the Federal Aviation Administration, with an estimated completion date (pushed back by COVID) of March, 2021. As we wait for that review to wrap up, critics and supporters of the Camden County project continue to go back and forth over issues like economic impact and safety of Georgia’s first spaceport. A Georgia Southern Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER) study earlier this month states that a single launch could attract approximately 4,000-5,000 visitors to the area, and could increase total business sales in southeast Georgia by as much as $3.6 million per launch. Those numbers, when tacked onto job creation both from construction and staffing paint a rosy economic picture for a part of the state looking to get back on its feet after coronavirus. Critics, however, such as Steve Weinkle, who lives near the launch site, call the study a “horror show,” and say that even if the FAA permits a launch site license, the spaceport will never be able to receive an actual launch license because of concerns of damage to the land under the potential launch path. Still though, with big players both at the State Capitol and in southeast Georgia lining up behind the spaceport, its odds of taking flight seem to look good. The FAA will issue a Final EIS for Spaceport Camden, without an additional public comment period, in the spring of 2021. The FAA intended to release a Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a 45-day public review and comment period in or around January 2021. However, the FAA's revised analyses have confirmed that all potential environmental impacts of the small-lift, liquid propellant vehicles with no first stage landing and the construction of associated support infrastructure are subsumed within the potential impacts of the medium-large lift class vehicle disclosed to the public in the March 2018 Draft EIS. Any application for a launch license from Spaceport Camden will require discrete environmental review, which will include an opportunity for public comment. Moreover, Executive Order 13927, EO on Accelerating the Nation's Economic Recovery from the COVID-19 Emergency by Expediting Infrastructure Investments and Other Activities, issued on June 4, 2020, requires the FAA and other executive branch Federal agencies to \"take all appropriate steps to use their lawful emergency authorities and other authorities to respond to the national emergency and to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery…\" and to \"take all reasonable measures to speed infrastructure investments and to speed other actions in addition to such investments that will strengthen the economy and return Americans to work, while providing appropriate protection for public health and safety, natural resources, and the environment, as required by law.\" The FAA believes that expediting the environmental review process for Spaceport Camden furthers the interests of Executive Order 13927. The FAA also intends to use the combined EIS/Record of Decision (ROD) process required by 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 304a(b) and 23 U.S.C. § 139(n)(2), Accelerated Decisionmaking in Environmental Reviews, and as described in Guidance on the Use of Combined Final Environmental Impact Statements/Records of Decision and Errata Sheets in National Environmental Policy Act Reviews, issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation in April 2019. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), FAA released the Spaceport Camden Draft EIS for a public review. The public comment period on the Draft EIS closed on June 14, 2018. The FAA is in the process of responding to comments submitted on the Draft EIS. The responses to these comments will be incorporated into the Revised Draft EIS, when released. \"Spaceport Camden is the single most important economic development project in the State of Georgia,\" said David Cole of Organic Code Development, LLC and part of a seasoned team on point to bring technology and commerce to Camden County. \"From the very beginning we promised Spaceport Camden would be a public private partnership. Today we are announcing that Camden County intends to make good on that promise,\" said Chairman Jimmy Starline.

And with Organic Code Development, we can create a world class space center,\" said Mr. Oliva. As a next step, Camden County and Organic Code Development, LLC will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to outline the parameters of the public private partnership and finalize the due diligence necessary to complete the transaction. Separate studies from the consulting giant PwC and Georgia Southern University’s Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER) demonstrate the business attractiveness of Spaceport Camden. PwC’s 2020 Aerospace manufacturing attractiveness rankings (PDF) lists the State of Georgia as the number one state in the country for aerospace manufacturing. According to the report, “[Georgia’s Aerospace and Defense] workforce of 108,000 is employed by more than 800 aerospace companies. Aerospace products, valued at $10.8 billion, account for the state’s top exports and represent the second largest manufacturing industry in the state, representing $57.5 billion in economic impact.” Separately, a report by CBAER (PDF) at Georgia Southern University found that Camden County already accounts for 278 of Georgia’s 926 direct space industry jobs. According to CBAER, “Camden County has a significantly higher level of specialization in the primary launch sector than does the state of Georgia…the addition of a spaceport could help increase the employment and wages already present in this area.” Direct space industry gross regional product has increased since 2008 for both Georgia and Camden County, while data shows (PDF) statewide GRP has grown by 88% and in Camden County by 125%. The average annual wages per worker in Camden County are $42,757, while the direct space sector average wages are $150,190 in 2019. This means that a typical job in the space sector earns 3.5 times the regional norm. “Georgia is the number one state in which to do business, as well as the number one state for aerospace manufacturing. Coupled with Camden’s existing expertise in the space industry, we are poised for massive growth with the approval of Spaceport Camden,” said Steve Howard, Camden County administrator and Spaceport Camden project lead. Camden County officials have previously touted Spaceport Camden’s potential to support transitioning military from Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay and to employ aerospace engineers from Georgia Tech University, the nation’s largest producer of engineers. Camden County anticipates a final decision on its Launch Site Operator’s License Application by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the spring of 2021. Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC), owner and operator of FAA-licensed commercial spaceport, Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska (PSCA), and Camden County, Georgia have entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to work cooperatively on establishing common operating environments for launch operators who wish to reach both orbits. By working together, AAC and Camden County can better support launch vehicle operator needs and the emerging commercial space launch market, while strengthening both endeavors. PSCA, based in Kodiak, Alaska, is ideal for launching into polar and sun synchronous orbits, while Camden is ideal for lower inclination and equatorial orbits. PSCA and Spaceport Camden can work together to establish common operating environments that have common processes, protocols and procedures. This will create a seamless, smooth and cost-efficient operating environment for small launch operators. AAC was established by the state of Alaska to develop a high technology aerospace industry in the state. AAC has 22 years of experience conducting launch operations of small and light-lift vertical launch vehicles from PSCA on Kodiak Island and has not accepted federal or state funds for operations and maintenance for the past five years. While having a similar business model to Camden County and Spaceport Camden, AAC offers vertical launch vehicles access to high-inclination and polar orbits from a responsive, flexible and low-cost spaceport. President and CEO Mark Lester joined AAC in 2018 and brings over 25 years of aerospace experience to the company with an emphasis on space operations in both government and private sector operations. “The Kodiak spaceport provides Alaskans with career opportunities focused on the future. Collaborating with Georgia’s spaceport allows both states to accelerate economic growth and increase job opportunities for our residents in this growing market,” said Alaska Lieutenant Governor Kevin Meyer. PSCA and Spaceport Camden will complement each other on orbital access and geographic diversity, while sharing a common market segment and business objectives. Once approved, Spaceport Camden will be uniquely positioned as the only low-inclination commercial vertical spaceport in the United States not co-located on a federal range. AAC-owned transportable launch support equipment and experience will help Spaceport Camden operate efficiently and accelerate operational readiness. This partnership will allow launch companies to more easily transport their licenses between the spaceports and will grant commercial customers access to both high and low-inclination orbits. “The future of robust access space rests with multi-user FAA-licensed commercial spaceports. By working together, Camden County and AAC are best positioned to advance America’s commercial vertical launch capabilities,” said AAC President and CEO Mark Lester. \n",
        "AAC and Camden County plan to create a cooperative and collaborative operating approach that creates efficiency and effectiveness for both launch sites. Both organizations plan to help maximize the benefits for their communities and states and to provide unmatched value to commercial launch customers. While collaborating on spaceport operations, the groups plan to explore advanced STEM opportunities and public-related interests. This partnership will promote the benefits of creating broader access to space for customers and will support an increase of diversity in spaceport users. “For the first time in a generation, Americans are passionate about space exploration again. Georgia and Alaska are harnessing this enthusiasm to attract new talent, inspire STEM education and build a high-tech economy,” said Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. “Camden’s partnership with Alaska Aerospace means that commercial space companies can reach any orbit from a commercial spaceport on American soil. That flexibility will drive innovation and job creation in both our states.” Camden County officials, AAC executives and the PSCA team look forward to creating a fruitful partnership to make commercial launch sites for small launch vehicles a success. “Alaska Aerospace is a leader in the commercial space industry. We look forward to learning from their expertise and utilizing key assets such as tracking technologies to accelerate the development of Spaceport Camden,” said Camden County Administrator and Spaceport Camden Project Lead Steve Howard. Two months after Camden County suddenly scaled back its yearslong quest to become a licensed spaceport capable of launching larger rockets, its chairman and top booster is still all in, saying space-related jobs are the future. And critics say the recast license application is just the most recent sign that the county might as well have launched $8 million straight into the sun. Spaceport’s biggest champion is confident his pet project will expand horizons for the coastal community of Woodbine. With the county’s pursuit of a spaceport, Camden is getting an opportunity to participate in the future, said county commission Chairman James Starline. The private space industry now handles satellites, but plenty of companies are banking on space tourism, suborbital travel, even mining asteroids. Starline was on the commission in 2012 when the county’s development authority started pursuing permits for a combined airport and spaceport on an old 4,000-acre Union Carbide site. “Space is certainly going to be a major factor in our future. I don’t think anyone can deny that. And we have a very good possibility of not only participating in but leading in the venture,” Starline said in an interview late last month. Some of the country’s 11 licensed spaceports are built only for vehicles to take off horizontally like airplanes. That is, at the ones that have had launches lately. But commercial vertical launches will be Camden’s uncommon advantage in the region, Starline said. Florida’s Cape Canaveral about 200 miles to the south offers some vertical commercial launch space, he said. “But if the military has something they need to do, the commercial is cast aside [at Canaveral.] That would not happen [in Camden] because we don’t have a military presence on the spaceport.” However, the iconic Canaveral image of giant rockets isn’t what Camden wants. Not now, anyway. At first it asked the federal government for a license to launch rockets as big as the 230-foot-tall SpaceX Falcon 9. But as of December, the vision is scaled back. Camden amended its Federal Aviation Administration spaceport application to eliminate references to medium and large rockets. Now county officials are just applying for a license to host small vehicle launches — think about the size of a mini-fridge. The county scaled back because they now think small vehicles are rapidly becoming the most important segment of the space market, said Camden County Administrator Steve Howard. And besides that, Howard said, smaller vehicles take less infrastructure, so Camden could hit the ground running faster once it gets a license. In this vision, Georgia makes its own “Space Coast” ecosystem, as Florida likes to call a stretch of its own Atlantic coast, home to two separately licensed spaceports at Cape Canaveral. Florida’s also got a new spaceport at Cecil Field outside Jacksonville. But that proximity to Florida is part of what’s got some folks skeptical: They see the county’s roughly $8 million spent since 2014 on this as money squandered on a quixotic space quest. Opposition has become a nearly full-time occupation for Camden resident Steve Weinkle, who’s built a website to share cautionary news about rocket explosions and fires in other places, post government documents about the Camden evaluation, rebut spaceport boosters and generally explain why he wants the plug pulled on it. “From an economic development standpoint, we’re wasting our money on something that’s purely speculative,” Weinkle said. He points to Midland, Texas. That city pledged $10 million to attract an XCOR Aerospace research and development center in 2012. And it went out of business. A former XCOR executive, Andrew Nelson, is now a Camden consultant. Weinkle also says the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas shows how life in a sleepy village can turn into a community punctuated with explosion warnings and sometimes rocked with actual explosions. To be sure, some states have already bet a lot more money on space than Camden’s $8 million wager. The state of New Mexico landed Virgin Galactic as an anchor tenant for its spaceport, but only after spending $220 million on building out a launch facility. Florida ties to the industry are so entrenched, it has a whole state economic development agency to woo space companies. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp endorsed the spaceport in 2017 when he was running for office. But that hasn’t translated to any executive-backed state legislation or funding to court the space industry. Indeed, the Georgia spaceport lost its No. 1 legislative booster to a 2018 resignation, after a British comedian duped former state Rep. Jason Spencer into yelling racial slurs and dropping his pants on TV. Weinkle thinks the federal government has cut Camden too much slack in its application saga. “The FAA should have pulled the plug on this years ago,” Weinkle said. And then there are the people who fear rockets falling on their Little Cumberland Island homes — or on Cumberland Island National Seashore — and starting fires far from any fire station. “We’ve been seen as being in the way,” said Kevin Lang, whose wife’s family has had a vacation house on Little Cumberland Island for decades. He cites FAA documents that outline the agency’s own concerns about what happens if there’s a failure, an explosion, a fire near the launch site. Launching rockets is complex enough, he said. “Add the complexity of a spaceport where a launch operator is going to have to buy a launch (insurance) policy that essentially underwrites all of the lives downrange, the unknown number of lives downrange, and their homes,” Lang said. Starline, the county commission chair, said every big project has opponents. He said the spaceport push is similar to building an industrial park and attracting tenants. Sure, counties, cities and the state regularly spend money to woo businesses. Counties pave roads or lay water lines to industrial sites, or even just pay cash to new businesses. The idea is to invest money at first expecting a good return for taxpayers in the future. But the typical industrial park is home to warehouse distribution centers frequented by 18-wheelers and doesn’t face the high hurdle of federal approval for an activity that scares some neighbors. Still, Starline isn’t worried about spaceports with underused launchpads. Launches are the icing on the cake, Starline said. They’re the culmination of a lot of other work which is what he wants to see done in the county: Research and development, payload preparation and so on. But still, that license is key. “We certainly need the launch from here to attract these others,” Starline said. Camden touted interest from ABL Space Systems in 2018, with a press release that announced the small satellite launch provider had a tentative pledge to explore future launch operations in the county. Camden anticipated a full contract by July, 2019. The California company started by former SpaceX engineers has been leasing a hangar building adjacent to the former St. Marys airport and about 70 acres at the airport for research and development, according to the county development authority. “They have actually let us know that at the end of this month they will be terminating the lease and they hope to explore Camden again when we have an approved spaceport operators license,” said Camden County Joint Development Authority Executive Director James Coughlin in an email this month. Starline also said spaceport opponents aren’t working with all the information that public officials have. “We have (nondisclosure agreements) signed, we have real estate transactions that we can’t discuss. We’re not able to put all of our cards on the table,” the county commissioner said. But once they can reveal the secret information, it’ll show the risk was justified, Starline said. Meanwhile, the FAA is reviewing Camden’s amended application. The federal agency has no deadline to finish its review, said spokeswoman Eva Ngai. “It is time to get some results. There’s no doubt about that,” Starline said. “We never anticipated it taking this long. But it has.” Indeed, if everybody agrees on something, it’s that it is time for a conclusion. But the conclusions they’re hoping for aren’t in the same orbit.\"\"\""

        "text=str(\"\"\"The Federal Aviation Administration is set to require a new environmental review for a scaled-down proposal to launch rockets off coastal Georgia, creating a new hurdle for Camden County’s eight-year quest to create a Spaceport. The federal agency announced Tuesday it will require Camden County to prepare another draft of an Environmental Impact Statement for its proposed spaceport, a controversial project local officials say will bring tourism and other economic benefits to the region. Environmental groups and other critics have railed against the potential safety hazards posed by the project. The revised environmental study requirement comes after the county downsized the rockets it plans to launch in its new license application in December to about the size of a mini-fridge. The project’s scope shrank after the FAA raised concerns about how the county could safeguard people who live near the proposed launch site. The U.S. Navy, which operates Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay about 10 miles away near the Florida border, also expressed national security concerns. Environmental groups, including the National Parks Conservation Association, One Hundred Miles and the Southern Environmental Law Center asked the FAA for another ecological review on the revised project. The groups are worried rocket launches could damage nearby Cumberland Island National Seashore. “Small rockets fail at a much higher rate than medium to large rockets, so the FAA must now consider the environmental impacts of these risky, unproven vehicles,” said Brian Gist, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Given the enormous risks Spaceport Camden poses to public health, private property and Cumberland Island, this is not the time for shortcuts and half-measures.” Camden’s revised plans call for smaller rockets as county officials aim to take part in the private space industry that includes satellites and potentially space tourism, suborbital travel and mining asteroids. The county first asked federal regulators to allow rockets as big as 230-foot tall SpaceX Falcon 9. Camden officials continued to express confidence in getting the project off the ground and said this week they’ve gained momentum now that the FAA is only asking the county for environmental and policy information. Camden taxpayers are on the hook for about $8 million so far, betting the Spaceport will one day generate a return on investment. “Today’s FAA release puts us one step closer to retaining the title of the Gateway to Space and bringing high tech opportunities to rural Georgia,” said Steve Howard, Camden’s administrator. “We will be continuing to work in parallel with the FAA, and we are looking forward to the next steps that have been outlined in the release. We hope for the project to move swiftly and smoothly in the upcoming months.” If approved, the spaceport would be one of 12 sites licensed in the U.S. to launch privately owned rockets. Located on a roughly 12,000-acre industrial property south of Brunswick, the county planned for the spaceport to attract tourists to watch rockets like the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch until it abruptly changed course late last year. Nearly eight years into its quest to build a spaceport in coastal Georgia, Camden County is proposing the use of drones and aerial surveillance on launch days, as part of a plan to monitor the number of people on private property and in a national park, which lie beneath its proposed rocket trajectories. NPR Atlanta affiliate WABE reports landowners say they were not consulted about the plans. It exacerbates an already-fraught relationship between the county and, in particular, some private landowners on Little Cumberland over the project. In its revised launch site operator license application, obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the county also says the new, smaller rockets it plans to launch could fail at least three times more often than its original plan. The issue of ensuring the safety of visitors and homeowners on Cumberland Island and Little Cumberland Island has dogged Camden’s proposal for years. No vertical-launch spaceports in the country launch over private homes, and the FAA has asked the county repeatedly how it would work. Camden submitted an updated application to operate a spaceport for smaller rockets in January after originally proposing to launch medium-to-large rockets. County leaders cited a more favorable market for small launch vehicles as the reason for the last-minute switch. The county declined a request for an interview about the revised application after being provided a copy of the document WABE is releasing. In a statement, the Board of Commissioners said the county “is not in a position to determine the authenticity of the document” and pointed to the “applicability of a variety of laws explicitly protecting the information contained in the Application from public disclosure.” “There’s no guarantee in anything. There’s risk in doing something and risk in doing nothing,” said Camden County Administrator Steve Howard about the project in a January interview. “And that’s why the board is looking at this as a potential opportunity.” “It’s important to me, it’s important to us as well to build for the future to make sure our citizens have opportunities,” he said. The county has invested more than $8 million on the proposal in an effort to create a new industry and jobs in Camden County by way of a commercial vertical-launch spaceport. A spaceport site operator license does not allow rockets to launch; proposed launches by rocket companies would each need to be subsequently licensed by the FAA. In the population monitoring and management plan in the revised application, the county proposes to track visitors to Cumberland Island National Seashore on launch days through the National Park Service’s existing public ferry and camping reservation system. But there are also private homes with residents and visitors on Cumberland, as well as private boaters who land on the beaches, who are not tracked by the park service. The county proposes to monitor private arrivals to Cumberland through Camden County first responders, National Park Service rangers, and “if necessary, fixed wing and drone aircraft operating under FAA regulations.” Unmanned aircraft are generally prohibited in the National Park System, except when “approved in writing” by the agency. Carol Ruckdeschel lives on Cumberland Island. She said she was not consulted about the plans and isn’t aware of any other residents being consulted. “It seems like it’s an incredible burden on the park service but also an incredible imposition on the wilderness area. People don’t come here expecting to be spied on with drones, airplanes, personnel, checkpoints and things like that.” “As a Camden County taxpayer, I’m not happy about it,” she said. “We’re all footing the bill for this folly.” Jill Hamilton-Anderson, spokeswoman for the Cumberland Island National Seashore, declined to comment on the plans because the agency had not yet received a copy of the revised application at this stage in the process. In previous comments to the FAA, the agency has been critical of the project’s original proposal. On Little Cumberland Island, which is privately owned, the county proposes to count the number of owners and visitors present on a launch day through the island homeowners association’s on-site caretaker. Additionally, the county proposes to monitor Little Cumberland visitation through “shore-based video surveillance (and if employed, drone and/or fixed wing aircraft).” Kevin Lang, vice president of the Little Cumberland Homes Association, confirmed landowners were not consulted about the details in advance of the application. He said the plan is “a little invasive and it’s pretty surreal to read in the application that that’s how they intend to treat our community.” “I’m not aware of any local government anywhere in our country that deploys these type of methods to try to verify the population of a particular area or where people are,” Lang said. “I believe it’s unprecedented. Of course, it’s also unprecedented to launch rockets over a residential community as well, so this project has a lot of unprecedented elements to it.” “I think the question would be, why won’t folks work with us to help us?” said Howard, Camden’s administrator, in January about the protests of some Little Cumberland Island homeowners. “And that’s kind of what I think the question should be. Why wouldn’t you help prosperity for a community? Why wouldn’t you be able to do this 12 times a year? Why couldn’t you do it? And I think those are things you’d have to look at. And nobody’s taking anybody’s property.” Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst who helped found and develop what is now Space Florida at Cape Canaveral, said there’s no precedent that he’s aware of in the United States for surveillance of private property during launches, nor any American precedent for homes beneath rocket trajectories. “Maybe the best corollary would be what China’s doing,” he said. “At their Xichang spaceport, entire villages are located downrange. Their spent rocket stages routinely fall near populated areas, sometimes destroying homes and private property.” Ellegood said Camden’s proposal would create a difficult situation for both residents and launch operators. And launching rockets is not easy to begin with. He pointed to Astra, a California startup that’s struggled recently to hold its first successful launch at Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska. “They’ve had problem after problem trying to overcome technical issues, weather issues, issues with the range and issues with the spaceport infrastructure itself,” he said. “Imagine if there were homes downrange and the repeated restrictions that would be put on those homes, and then imagine how people not obeying those restrictions might impact the launch operation,” he said. Camden County’s plans also include closure of waters near the site. Boats would need “pre-authorization as a property owner or registered guests of an owner” in order to pass through the “Safety Zone” maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard on a launch day. Closing public waterways is common for coastal spaceports around the country, and several launches have been scrubbed because of wayward boats in closed downrange waters, including one of Astra’s in Alaska earlier this month. In 2018, several local fishermen testified in Camden about the negative effect closing those waters for commercial space activity would have on their businesses. When conducting a safety analysis of Camden’s proposed trajectories in 2018, an FAA engineer pointed out that a smaller vehicle would reduce a casualty area, but that those smaller rockets could be less reliable and have a higher probability of failure. In its revised application addressing safety, the county tripled the probability of rocket failure to 20% for smaller rockets, from the original range of 2.5% to 6% for medium-to-large launch vehicles. When asked about this increased failure rate for smaller rockets in January, as compared to the county’s original proposal, Howard with Camden County suggested to WABE the FAA emails were outdated. “We want a mature rocket launching from Spaceport Camden. But let’s not forget the whole reason behind this project,” he continued. “It’s really not about launching. That’s the catalyst, but you want everything else around it: STEM programs, educational programs, manufacturing, all those kinds of things.” The county proposes up to 12 launches per year, with up to an additional 42 wet dress and static fire engine tests. A 20% failure rate would equate to at least two of those launches per year. In its calculation of risk for the uninvolved public beneath the proposed rocket paths, which is required by the FAA’s licensing process, the county outlined a “conservative” estimate of population present on the islands. Per Camden’s calculations, their proposed launches would pass the FAA’s safety regulations. Launches, by Camden’s calculations, would only exceed the level of risk to the general public prohibited by the federal government in the uninhabited marsh nearest to the proposed spaceport site. But the plan is still problematic, argued Brian Gist, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has advocated against the proposal on environmental and good governance grounds. “What they’re trying to do is make the numbers work while trying to launch rockets over a downrange community,” he said. “The formula is intended to calculate a certain degree of risk. But whether it’s one person in a house or 40 people in a house, if that house is hit by debris from a rocket, that’s still going to be a terrible outcome for that person or those people.” “How do you determine a risk factor?” asked Ruckdeschel. “Seems like one person would be too many. There’s a lot I don’t understand about [the proposal] at all.” Another section of Camden County’s revised application, which was expressly requested by the FAA, is its plan to fight potential fires caused by rocket debris on Little Cumberland Island. The county proposes using specially equipped ATVs, which would land on Little Cumberland beaches in the event of a fire, and explained it is also repairing a water buffalo for the island to contribute to the mitigation efforts. The county predicts that with these ATVs pre-staged in the water they would be able to reach any area of the island within 15 to 30 minutes. Lang of the island’s homeowners association calls the plan “completely inadequate.” “You’re not going to be able to get there quickly enough,” he said. “And when you’re there, there are parts of the island that are only accessible by foot. You can’t get machinery of any significant size in to fight the fire. You’re not going to be able to mobilize enough via the air to get enough water on a multi-point fire.” He pointed out that vehicles are only able to access the island from the beaches in a few places because of a bluff around its exterior, and, while it has a trail system, most of the island remains inaccessible. Lang said there’s been “absolutely no communication” between the county and Little Cumberland about the plans in the application that involve the island. “We know our island better than they know our island. And for them not to engage with us at all and to develop this mitigation plan is pretty amazing.” “The lack of transparency has allowed this project to exist for five years,” Lang argued. “If Camden County had actually revealed to the public what’s going on with this project and been evenhanded that launching rockets is very unlikely, then the support for this project would melt away.” Gist, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, also decried the lack of transparency about the project throughout the process. His organization has settled a lawsuit with the FAA about unfilled Freedom of Information Act requests related to the spaceport, and sued the county on behalf of One Hundred Miles environmental group over alleged Georgia Open Records Act violations. “This project is an example of why open records laws exist,” he said. “The public shouldn’t have to jump through a bunch of hoops to figure out basic information about a project when that information deals with things like risk of bodily harm, risk to their property, government management of private property. Those are things that the public should have access to and has a right to know.” On behalf of One Hundred Miles, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) has amended its ongoing lawsuit in Camden County Superior Court against Camden County and Spaceport Camden consultant Andrew Nelson for failing to meet requirements under the Georgia Open Records Act. Over the past several years, One Hundred Miles and SELC have sent a series of public records requests to the County about what would happen in the event of a rocket explosion from the proposed spaceport or in the air over nearby communities and sensitive coastal areas, including Little Cumberland Island and the Cumberland Island National Seashore. The groups have repeatedly asked for critical information concerning evacuation zones, hazard areas, and safety zones, as well as the County’s formal license application to operate a commercial spaceport submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Camden County has refused to provide one single page of public records in response to these requests. “After more than seven years, the County continues to keep even the most basic details about this project from the public by violating the law,” said Megan Desrosiers, Executive Director of One Hundred Miles. “How can Camden communities feel assured that millions of their tax payer dollars are being spent wisely when they are denied any semblance of transparency?” Documents obtained through SELC’s now-settled federal challenge against the FAA contain the same information that Camden County continues to withhold, and in some cases are the exact documents in full. Other documents released by the FAA demonstrate that the County routinely and illegally marks public records as exempt from disclosure, despite having no confidential information. One such document is the County’s revised license application following its last-minute decision in December 2019 to change the project from launching medium-to-large sized rockets to launching only small launch vehicles, which fail at a significantly higher rate. “Camden County has gone to great lengths to hide the serious risks this project poses to public safety, personal property, and coastal way of life,” said April Lipscomb, Senior Attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “It’s time for the County to stop this pattern of hiding information.” The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Office of Commercial Space Transportation is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to analyze the environmental impacts of a proposed commercial space launch site (known as Spaceport Camden) in Camden County, Georgia. The Camden County, Georgia Board of Commissioners (the County) proposes to develop a launch site for the integration, test, and launch of vertical launch vehicles. Under the Proposed Action analyzed in the EIS, the County would construct and operate Spaceport Camden, a commercial space launch site consisting of a vertical launch site, a landing zone, a control center complex, and another facility that would include provisions for visitors and viewing launches. The County plans to offer the site for up to 12 vertical launches per year. The County will be required to obtain a Launch Site Operator License from the FAA for the operation of the proposed Spaceport Camden. The FAA is the lead Federal agency for preparing the EIS for analyzing the environmental impacts of the proposal. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Park Service (NPS) are cooperating agencies. The EIS will evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposal, including construction of launch site infrastructure, launch operations, offsite communication, control, and launch facilities, and provisions for visitors and viewing launches. The EIS will evaluate the Proposed Action along with the No Action Alternative, and other reasonable alternatives that may be identified during the scoping process. The applicant will work together with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to obtain a Section 404 permit, as necessary, before constructing the proposed site. Revised analyses have confirmed that all potential environmental impacts of the small-lift launch vehicles are subsumed within the potential impacts of the medium-large lift class vehicle disclosed to the public in the Draft EIS, issued in March 2018. Moreover, the FAA will perform additional NEPA analyses for applications from future launch vehicle operators seeking to operate from Spaceport Camden. This additional analysis would address the potential impacts of the launch of their specific vehicle. The FAA also believes that expediting the environmental review process for Spaceport Camden furthers the interests of Executive Order 13927, Accelerating the Nation’s Economic Recovery from the COVID-19 Emergency by Expediting Infrastructure Investments and Other Activities. The FAA has therefore revised its approach and will issue a Final EIS without an additional public comment period. The Final EIS will address updates to the Proposed Action since the release of the 2018 Draft EIS and will consider the updates across all appropriate resource areas. The Final EIS will incorporate responses to all comments received on the 2018 Draft EIS. The FAA is actively developing the Final EIS which is expected to be released in March 2021. The Final EIS addresses Camden’s proposed launch site operations. Camden County and the Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER) at Georgia Southern University has released a new study on the economic impact of space tourism on coastal Georgia. The report estimates that a single launch could attract approximately 4,000-5,000 visitors to the area. CBAER estimates that 38 to 45 jobs connected to tourism and hospitality would be supported long-term by the project as well. While there would be some additional new jobs as a result, the primary impact on employment would likely be adding more hours to existing employees, shifting employees from part-time to full-time work, or increasing their income due to increased customer traffic and visitor counts. “Building Spaceport Camden could bolster additional spending in the area’s hospitality industry throughout Camden County and the southeast Georgia region,” said Benjamin McKay, Assistant Director for the Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER). “The potential per-launch benefit to total employee compensation (Labor Income) could reach $1.1 million, with sizeable increases in the total goods and services used in the region (Gross Regional Product) and total business sales (Output).” CBAER estimates that from Spaceport Camden could increase the gross regional product of southeast Georgia by as much as $1.8 million and increase total business sales by as much as $3.6 million per launch. “Having overseen the Eastern Range for the United States Air Force and been involved with commercial space for the past decade, I can attest to the growing launch demand in the commercial space sector,” said Major General Robert S. Dickman, former USAF commander of the 45th Space Wing, former Director of the Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral, and current Camden County resident. “Spaceport Camden is an ideal location for the safe launch of the small satellites and rockets that are rapidly becoming the most important segment of this new market.” Georgia Southern University previously estimated that Spaceport Camden would generate more than $22 million in annual economic activity in addition to the more than $9 million in economic activity that will be generated from construction in the first 15 months of operations. However, this previous study did not research the impact of Spaceport Camden on tourism and hospitality. “Small-lift launch vehicle launches mean big business for our hotels and restaurants,” said Camden County Administrator and Spaceport Camden project lead, Steve Howard. “Many hospitality businesses have been suffering as a result of COVID-19. This report shows that a launch from Spaceport Camden can revitalize Camden’s tourism industry and ignite our recovery.” Spaceport Camden is a speculative attempt to bolster one rural county’s economy, but it jeopardizes its most valuable natural resource — one that belongs to every one of us: a federally-protected Wilderness Area and Cumberland Island National Seashore. Small rocket launches can send flaming debris and toxic material from the sky, destroying the habitats of threatened and endangered species, and can ignite Cumberland Island’s centuries-old maritime forest. Our coast is of value and significance to every Georgian. To minimize the implications of a project like this on both the state and national levels is a severe oversight by Governor Kemp. Most importantly – allowing an unnecessary, for-profit spaceport to launch over this Wilderness Area sets a dangerous precedent for ALL Wilderness Areas in the United States. The FAA will issue its final decision for the Spaceport Camden launch site in March 2021, without opportunity for further public comment. If this project moves forward, we are allowing wilderness to be superseded by the interests of private stakeholders at any time. Our officials must understand that a Spaceport should never be authorized to fly over protected Wilderness. Currently Spaceport Camden remains under environmental review and permitting by the Federal Aviation Administration, with an estimated completion date (pushed back by COVID) of March, 2021. As we wait for that review to wrap up, critics and supporters of the Camden County project continue to go back and forth over issues like economic impact and safety of Georgia’s first spaceport. A Georgia Southern Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER) study earlier this month states that a single launch could attract approximately 4,000-5,000 visitors to the area, and could increase total business sales in southeast Georgia by as much as $3.6 million per launch. Those numbers, when tacked onto job creation both from construction and staffing paint a rosy economic picture for a part of the state looking to get back on its feet after coronavirus. Critics, however, such as Steve Weinkle, who lives near the launch site, call the study a “horror show,” and say that even if the FAA permits a launch site license, the spaceport will never be able to receive an actual launch license because of concerns of damage to the land under the potential launch path. Still though, with big players both at the State Capitol and in southeast Georgia lining up behind the spaceport, its odds of taking flight seem to look good. The FAA will issue a Final EIS for Spaceport Camden, without an additional public comment period, in the spring of 2021. The FAA intended to release a Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a 45-day public review and comment period in or around January 2021. However, the FAA's revised analyses have confirmed that all potential environmental impacts of the small-lift, liquid propellant vehicles with no first stage landing and the construction of associated support infrastructure are subsumed within the potential impacts of the medium-large lift class vehicle disclosed to the public in the March 2018 Draft EIS. Any application for a launch license from Spaceport Camden will require discrete environmental review, which will include an opportunity for public comment. Moreover, Executive Order 13927, EO on Accelerating the Nation's Economic Recovery from the COVID-19 Emergency by Expediting Infrastructure Investments and Other Activities, issued on June 4, 2020, requires the FAA and other executive branch Federal agencies to \"take all appropriate steps to use their lawful emergency authorities and other authorities to respond to the national emergency and to facilitate the Nation's economic recovery…\" and to \"take all reasonable measures to speed infrastructure investments and to speed other actions in addition to such investments that will strengthen the economy and return Americans to work, while providing appropriate protection for public health and safety, natural resources, and the environment, as required by law.\" The FAA believes that expediting the environmental review process for Spaceport Camden furthers the interests of Executive Order 13927. The FAA also intends to use the combined EIS/Record of Decision (ROD) process required by 49 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 304a(b) and 23 U.S.C. § 139(n)(2), Accelerated Decisionmaking in Environmental Reviews, and as described in Guidance on the Use of Combined Final Environmental Impact Statements/Records of Decision and Errata Sheets in National Environmental Policy Act Reviews, issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation in April 2019. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), FAA released the Spaceport Camden Draft EIS for a public review. The public comment period on the Draft EIS closed on June 14, 2018. The FAA is in the process of responding to comments submitted on the Draft EIS. The responses to these comments will be incorporated into the Revised Draft EIS, when released. \"Spaceport Camden is the single most important economic development project in the State of Georgia,\" said David Cole of Organic Code Development, LLC and part of a seasoned team on point to bring technology and commerce to Camden County. \"From the very beginning we promised Spaceport Camden would be a public private partnership. Today we are announcing that Camden County intends to make good on that promise,\" said Chairman Jimmy Starline. The public/private partnership between Organic Code Development, LLC and Camden County will allow Spaceport Camden to become a fully integrated Space and Research center that incorporates rocket launch capabilities and a technology and research business park. It will attract big data analytic researchers, aerospace manufacturing, professional services, and deep space communications experts. The interdisciplinary technology center will offer collaborative research opportunities in artificial intelligence, aerospace, defense, engineering, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, software development, information technology robotics, and cyber security. The fiber and power network already available at Spaceport Camden will be capable of supporting high performance compute or network operating centers. Spaceport Camden will serve as the anchor for the proposed development, attracting orbital launch providers and offering aerospace assembly/staging facilities and propulsion testing. \"The vision behind Spaceport Camden has always been it serving as a catalyst project to create a space and high technology hub in Camden County to drive economic development,\" said Vice Chairman Gary Blount. Organic Code Development, LLC restores commercial land for commerce, conservation, and community service. The organization specializes in turning sites into growth opportunities through research, development, and innovation. The experienced team behind Organic Code Development, LLC includes Mr. John Oliva and Mr. David Cole. Mr. Oliva is Managing Director of Capital City Advisors RE Development and an experienced aerospace industry investor who served 11 years on the Board of Directors of Astrotech/ASO Corporation a company that provided space habitat microgravity experimentation equipment and technical launch services to NASA during Space Shuttle flights and satellite launches. Mr. Cole is a Georgia Tech alumni and Vice President of Special Operations at NAI Brannen Goddard. Mr. Cole specializes in technology-related real estate transactions with over 25 years of experience in providing development and construction management services to clients for adaptive reuse, re-purposing, and property acquisition. He recently represented DataBank for the CODA Georgia Tech High Performance Data Center project with Georgia Tech and Portman Holdings and Tyler Perry Studios in the sale of Greenbriar Tyler Perry Studio. \"In the 1960's Camden County was declared the Gateway to Space and with this announcement we are one step closer to retaining the title of Gateway to Space and Innovation,\" said Steve Howard, Camden County Administrator and Spaceport Camden Project Lead. \"The Camden Aerospace and Data Science Campus at Spaceport Camden will offer unparalleled educational opportunities to students at Georgia Universities and will attract cutting edge businesses to the state. And with Organic Code Development, we can create a world class space center,\" said Mr. Oliva. As a next step, Camden County and Organic Code Development, LLC will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to outline the parameters of the public private partnership and finalize the due diligence necessary to complete the transaction. Separate studies from the consulting giant PwC and Georgia Southern University’s Center for Business Analytics and Economic Research (CBAER) demonstrate the business attractiveness of Spaceport Camden. PwC’s 2020 Aerospace manufacturing attractiveness rankings (PDF) lists the State of Georgia as the number one state in the country for aerospace manufacturing. According to the report, “[Georgia’s Aerospace and Defense] workforce of 108,000 is employed by more than 800 aerospace companies. Aerospace products, valued at $10.8 billion, account for the state’s top exports and represent the second largest manufacturing industry in the state, representing $57.5 billion in economic impact.” Separately, a report by CBAER (PDF) at Georgia Southern University found that Camden County already accounts for 278 of Georgia’s 926 direct space industry jobs. According to CBAER, “Camden County has a significantly higher level of specialization in the primary launch sector than does the state of Georgia…the addition of a spaceport could help increase the employment and wages already present in this area.” Direct space industry gross regional product has increased since 2008 for both Georgia and Camden County, while data shows (PDF) statewide GRP has grown by 88% and in Camden County by 125%. The average annual wages per worker in Camden County are $42,757, while the direct space sector average wages are $150,190 in 2019. This means that a typical job in the space sector earns 3.5 times the regional norm. “Georgia is the number one state in which to do business, as well as the number one state for aerospace manufacturing. Coupled with Camden’s existing expertise in the space industry, we are poised for massive growth with the approval of Spaceport Camden,” said Steve Howard, Camden County administrator and Spaceport Camden project lead. Camden County officials have previously touted Spaceport Camden’s potential to support transitioning military from Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay and to employ aerospace engineers from Georgia Tech University, the nation’s largest producer of engineers. Camden County anticipates a final decision on its Launch Site Operator’s License Application by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the spring of 2021. Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC), owner and operator of FAA-licensed commercial spaceport, Pacific Spaceport Complex Alaska (PSCA), and Camden County, Georgia have entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to work cooperatively on establishing common operating environments for launch operators who wish to reach both orbits. By working together, AAC and Camden County can better support launch vehicle operator needs and the emerging commercial space launch market, while strengthening both endeavors. PSCA, based in Kodiak, Alaska, is ideal for launching into polar and sun synchronous orbits, while Camden is ideal for lower inclination and equatorial orbits. PSCA and Spaceport Camden can work together to establish common operating environments that have common processes, protocols and procedures. This will create a seamless, smooth and cost-efficient operating environment for small launch operators. AAC was established by the state of Alaska to develop a high technology aerospace industry in the state. AAC has 22 years of experience conducting launch operations of small and light-lift vertical launch vehicles from PSCA on Kodiak Island and has not accepted federal or state funds for operations and maintenance for the past five years. While having a similar business model to Camden County and Spaceport Camden, AAC offers vertical launch vehicles access to high-inclination and polar orbits from a responsive, flexible and low-cost spaceport. President and CEO Mark Lester joined AAC in 2018 and brings over 25 years of aerospace experience to the company with an emphasis on space operations in both government and private sector operations. “The Kodiak spaceport provides Alaskans with career opportunities focused on the future. Collaborating with Georgia’s spaceport allows both states to accelerate economic growth and increase job opportunities for our residents in this growing market,” said Alaska Lieutenant Governor Kevin Meyer. PSCA and Spaceport Camden will complement each other on orbital access and geographic diversity, while sharing a common market segment and business objectives. Once approved, Spaceport Camden will be uniquely positioned as the only low-inclination commercial vertical spaceport in the United States not co-located on a federal range. AAC-owned transportable launch support equipment and experience will help Spaceport Camden operate efficiently and accelerate operational readiness. This partnership will allow launch companies to more easily transport their licenses between the spaceports and will grant commercial customers access to both high and low-inclination orbits. “The future of robust access space rests with multi-user FAA-licensed commercial spaceports. By working together, Camden County and AAC are best positioned to advance America’s commercial vertical launch capabilities,” said AAC President and CEO Mark Lester. \n",
        "AAC and Camden County plan to create a cooperative and collaborative operating approach that creates efficiency and effectiveness for both launch sites. Both organizations plan to help maximize the benefits for their communities and states and to provide unmatched value to commercial launch customers. While collaborating on spaceport operations, the groups plan to explore advanced STEM opportunities and public-related interests. This partnership will promote the benefits of creating broader access to space for customers and will support an increase of diversity in spaceport users. “For the first time in a generation, Americans are passionate about space exploration again. Georgia and Alaska are harnessing this enthusiasm to attract new talent, inspire STEM education and build a high-tech economy,” said Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. “Camden’s partnership with Alaska Aerospace means that commercial space companies can reach any orbit from a commercial spaceport on American soil. That flexibility will drive innovation and job creation in both our states.” Camden County officials, AAC executives and the PSCA team look forward to creating a fruitful partnership to make commercial launch sites for small launch vehicles a success. “Alaska Aerospace is a leader in the commercial space industry. We look forward to learning from their expertise and utilizing key assets such as tracking technologies to accelerate the development of Spaceport Camden,” said Camden County Administrator and Spaceport Camden Project Lead Steve Howard. Two months after Camden County suddenly scaled back its yearslong quest to become a licensed spaceport capable of launching larger rockets, its chairman and top booster is still all in, saying space-related jobs are the future. And critics say the recast license application is just the most recent sign that the county might as well have launched $8 million straight into the sun. Spaceport’s biggest champion is confident his pet project will expand horizons for the coastal community of Woodbine. With the county’s pursuit of a spaceport, Camden is getting an opportunity to participate in the future, said county commission Chairman James Starline. The private space industry now handles satellites, but plenty of companies are banking on space tourism, suborbital travel, even mining asteroids. Starline was on the commission in 2012 when the county’s development authority started pursuing permits for a combined airport and spaceport on an old 4,000-acre Union Carbide site. “Space is certainly going to be a major factor in our future. I don’t think anyone can deny that. And we have a very good possibility of not only participating in but leading in the venture,” Starline said in an interview late last month. Some of the country’s 11 licensed spaceports are built only for vehicles to take off horizontally like airplanes. That is, at the ones that have had launches lately. But commercial vertical launches will be Camden’s uncommon advantage in the region, Starline said. Florida’s Cape Canaveral about 200 miles to the south offers some vertical commercial launch space, he said. “But if the military has something they need to do, the commercial is cast aside [at Canaveral.] That would not happen [in Camden] because we don’t have a military presence on the spaceport.” However, the iconic Canaveral image of giant rockets isn’t what Camden wants. Not now, anyway. At first it asked the federal government for a license to launch rockets as big as the 230-foot-tall SpaceX Falcon 9. But as of December, the vision is scaled back. Camden amended its Federal Aviation Administration spaceport application to eliminate references to medium and large rockets. Now county officials are just applying for a license to host small vehicle launches — think about the size of a mini-fridge. The county scaled back because they now think small vehicles are rapidly becoming the most important segment of the space market, said Camden County Administrator Steve Howard. And besides that, Howard said, smaller vehicles take less infrastructure, so Camden could hit the ground running faster once it gets a license. In this vision, Georgia makes its own “Space Coast” ecosystem, as Florida likes to call a stretch of its own Atlantic coast, home to two separately licensed spaceports at Cape Canaveral. Florida’s also got a new spaceport at Cecil Field outside Jacksonville. But that proximity to Florida is part of what’s got some folks skeptical: They see the county’s roughly $8 million spent since 2014 on this as money squandered on a quixotic space quest. Opposition has become a nearly full-time occupation for Camden resident Steve Weinkle, who’s built a website to share cautionary news about rocket explosions and fires in other places, post government documents about the Camden evaluation, rebut spaceport boosters and generally explain why he wants the plug pulled on it. “From an economic development standpoint, we’re wasting our money on something that’s purely speculative,” Weinkle said. He points to Midland, Texas. That city pledged $10 million to attract an XCOR Aerospace research and development center in 2012. And it went out of business. A former XCOR executive, Andrew Nelson, is now a Camden consultant. Weinkle also says the SpaceX facility in Boca Chica, Texas shows how life in a sleepy village can turn into a community punctuated with explosion warnings and sometimes rocked with actual explosions. To be sure, some states have already bet a lot more money on space than Camden’s $8 million wager. The state of New Mexico landed Virgin Galactic as an anchor tenant for its spaceport, but only after spending $220 million on building out a launch facility. Florida ties to the industry are so entrenched, it has a whole state economic development agency to woo space companies. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp endorsed the spaceport in 2017 when he was running for office. But that hasn’t translated to any executive-backed state legislation or funding to court the space industry. Indeed, the Georgia spaceport lost its No. 1 legislative booster to a 2018 resignation, after a British comedian duped former state Rep. Jason Spencer into yelling racial slurs and dropping his pants on TV. Weinkle thinks the federal government has cut Camden too much slack in its application saga. “The FAA should have pulled the plug on this years ago,” Weinkle said. And then there are the people who fear rockets falling on their Little Cumberland Island homes — or on Cumberland Island National Seashore — and starting fires far from any fire station. “We’ve been seen as being in the way,” said Kevin Lang, whose wife’s family has had a vacation house on Little Cumberland Island for decades. He cites FAA documents that outline the agency’s own concerns about what happens if there’s a failure, an explosion, a fire near the launch site. Launching rockets is complex enough, he said. “Add the complexity of a spaceport where a launch operator is going to have to buy a launch (insurance) policy that essentially underwrites all of the lives downrange, the unknown number of lives downrange, and their homes,” Lang said. Starline, the county commission chair, said every big project has opponents. He said the spaceport push is similar to building an industrial park and attracting tenants. Sure, counties, cities and the state regularly spend money to woo businesses. Counties pave roads or lay water lines to industrial sites, or even just pay cash to new businesses. The idea is to invest money at first expecting a good return for taxpayers in the future. But the typical industrial park is home to warehouse distribution centers frequented by 18-wheelers and doesn’t face the high hurdle of federal approval for an activity that scares some neighbors. Still, Starline isn’t worried about spaceports with underused launchpads. Launches are the icing on the cake, Starline said. They’re the culmination of a lot of other work which is what he wants to see done in the county: Research and development, payload preparation and so on. But still, that license is key. “We certainly need the launch from here to attract these others,” Starline said. Camden touted interest from ABL Space Systems in 2018, with a press release that announced the small satellite launch provider had a tentative pledge to explore future launch operations in the county. Camden anticipated a full contract by July, 2019. The California company started by former SpaceX engineers has been leasing a hangar building adjacent to the former St. Marys airport and about 70 acres at the airport for research and development, according to the county development authority. “They have actually let us know that at the end of this month they will be terminating the lease and they hope to explore Camden again when we have an approved spaceport operators license,” said Camden County Joint Development Authority Executive Director James Coughlin in an email this month. Starline also said spaceport opponents aren’t working with all the information that public officials have. “We have (nondisclosure agreements) signed, we have real estate transactions that we can’t discuss. We’re not able to put all of our cards on the table,” the county commissioner said. But once they can reveal the secret information, it’ll show the risk was justified, Starline said. Meanwhile, the FAA is reviewing Camden’s amended application. The federal agency has no deadline to finish its review, said spokeswoman Eva Ngai. “It is time to get some results. There’s no doubt about that,” Starline said. “We never anticipated it taking this long. But it has.” Indeed, if everybody agrees on something, it’s that it is time for a conclusion. But the conclusions they’re hoping for aren’t in the same orbit.\"\"\")"
