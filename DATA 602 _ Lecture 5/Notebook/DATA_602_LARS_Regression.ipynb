This is particularly true for problems with few observations (samples) or more input predictors (p) than variables than samples (n).\n","\n","One approach to address the stability of regression models is to change the loss function to include additional costs for a model that has large coefficients. Linear regression models that use these modified loss functions during training are referred to collectively as penalized linear regression.\n","\n","Least Angle Regression, LAR or LARS for short, is an alternative approach to solving the optimization problem of fitting the penalized model. Technically, LARS is a forward stepwise version of feature selection for regression that can be adapted for the Lasso model.\n","\n","Unlike the Lasso, it does not require a hyperparameter that controls the weighting of the penalty in the loss function. Instead, the weighting is discovered automatically by LARS.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gnZdDuFv1pfy","outputId":"5c745ab7-43ad-43ca-e46c-b23be2607778"},"source":["# load and summarize the housing dataset\n","from pandas import read_csv\n","from matplotlib import pyplot\n","# load dataset\n","url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/housing.csv'\n","dataframe = read_csv(url, header=None)\n","# summarize shape\n","print(dataframe.shape)\n","# summarize first few lines\n","print(dataframe.head())"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["(506, 14)\n","        0     1     2   3      4      5   ...  8      9     10      11    12    13\n","0  0.00632  18.0  2.31   0  0.538  6.575  ...   1  296.0  15.3  396.90  4.98  24.0\n","1  0.02731   0.0  7.07   0  0.469  6.421  ...   2  242.0  17.8  396.90  9.14  21.6\n","2  0.02729   0.0  7.07   0  0.469  7.185  ...   2  242.0  17.8  392.83  4.03  34.7\n","3  0.03237   0.0  2.18   0  0.458  6.998  ...   3  222.0  18.7  394.63  2.94  33.4\n","4  0.06905   0.0  2.18   0  0.458  7.147  ...   3  222.0  18.7  396.90  5.33  36.2\n","\n","[5 rows x 14 columns]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UpLDaX-A1vOO"},"source":["# define model\n","from sklearn.linear_model import Lars\n","model = Lars()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"u6Z4xHRq2C-R","outputId":"b04ad2e2-d5cb-413f-b559-3b737f2206ef"},"source":["# evaluate an lars regression model on the dataset\n","from numpy import mean\n","from numpy import std\n","from numpy import absolute\n","from pandas import read_csv\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold\n","from sklearn.linear_model import Lars\n","# load the dataset\n","url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/housing.csv'\n","dataframe = read_csv(url, header=None)\n","data = dataframe.values\n","X, y = data[:, :-1], data[:, -1]\n","# define model\n","model = Lars()\n","# define model evaluation method\n","cv = RepeatedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=3, random_state=1)\n","# evaluate model\n","scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error', cv=cv, n_jobs=-1)\n","# force scores to be positive\n","scores = absolute(scores)\n","print('Mean MAE: %.3f (%.3f)' % (mean(scores), std(scores)))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mean MAE: 3.432 (0.552)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"SMZbpU2Q2Rx6","outputId":"fe894209-804a-4942-d723-1af94db42c0b"},"source":["# make a prediction with a lars regression model on the dataset\n","from pandas import read_csv\n","from sklearn.linear_model import Lars\n","# load the dataset\n","url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/housing.csv'\n","dataframe = read_csv(url, header=None)\n","data = dataframe.values\n","X, y = data[:, :-1], data[:, -1]\n","# define model\n","model = Lars()\n","# fit model\n","model.fit(X, y)\n","# define new data\n","row = [0.00632,18.00,2.310,0,0.5380,6.5750,65.20,4.0900,1,296.0,15.30,396.90,4.98]\n","# make a prediction\n","yhat = model.predict([row])\n","# summarize prediction\n","print('Predicted: %.3f' % yhat)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Predicted: 29.904\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tnWrrDnn2n1O","outputId":"eb811291-96a9-4dc8-966d-f1ffe05d6d9e"},"source":["# use automatically configured the lars regression algorithm\n","from numpy import arange\n","from pandas import read_csv\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LarsCV\n","from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold\n","# load the dataset\n","url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/housing.csv'\n","dataframe = read_csv(url, header=None)\n","data = dataframe.values\n","X, y = data[:, :-1], data[:, -1]\n","# define model evaluation method\n","cv = RepeatedKFold(n_splits=10, n_repeats=3, random_state=1)\n","# define model\n","model = LarsCV(cv=cv, n_jobs=-1)\n","# fit model\n","model.fit(X, y)\n","# summarize chosen configuration\n","print('alpha: %f' % model.alpha_)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["alpha: 0.001623\n"]}]}]}
